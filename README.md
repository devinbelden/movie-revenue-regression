# WGU Capstone Project: Predicting Film Revenue

This project was completed as the capstone to earning my BS in Computer Science through WGU. The contents are as follows:

* Raw and cleaned datasets (as `.csv` files)
* An iPython notebook file containing all the code written for data manipulation, model creation/training, and widget creation
* A `.twbx` file containing a dashboard, viewable in Tableau Public
* A `requirements.txt` file
* A writeup, in `.docx` and PDF format, containing the project proposal, executive summary, and technical documentation
